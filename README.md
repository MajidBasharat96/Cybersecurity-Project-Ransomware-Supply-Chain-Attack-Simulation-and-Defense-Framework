## 📌 Overview
This project simulates **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) supply chain attacks** and demonstrates defense strategies through monitoring, anomaly detection, and incident response workflows.

It provides a **realistic cybersecurity project** for portfolios, showcasing:
- Threat modeling of RaaS in supply chains.
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for attack techniques.
- Python-based anomaly detection scripts.
- Incident response simulation.
- Secure CI/CD pipeline setup.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Attack simulation: demonstrates how RaaS infiltrates supply chains.
- Defense: anomaly detection scripts, monitoring, and automated alerts.
- Incident response: playbooks and log analysis examples.
- Portfolio-ready: polished README, GitHub Actions CI, badges, and documentation.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Scikit-learn & Pandas** for anomaly detection
- **Flask** (optional) for dashboard visualization
- **YAML/JSON** configs for simulation parameters
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. Generate synthetic supply chain logs (`data/generate_logs.py`).
2. Run anomaly detection (`detection/detect_anomalies.py`).
3. Simulate incident response (`incident_response/run_response.py`).
4. Review alerts and mitigation in `docs/report.md`.

---

## ✅ CI/CD Integration
This repo includes a **GitHub Actions workflow**:
- Runs Python tests on push/PR.
- Lints code with flake8.
- Security check with `bandit`.
